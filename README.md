# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository was made to support the learning of algorithm analysis and data structures.

## Sorting algorithms

Sorting algorithms are a nice study case to learn algorithm analysis since it is possible to visualize how simple changes to the code influence the better/worst scenario. Here we have implemented the following techniques and with their respective description.

```json
{
  "sorting/": {
    "bubble-sort": "O(nˆ2)",
    "counting-sort": "O(n)",
    "heap-sort": "O(nlogn)",
    "insertion-sort": "O(nˆ2)",
    "merge-sort": "O(nlogn)",
    "quick-sort": "O(nlogn)",
    "radix-sort": "O(n)",
    "selection-sort": "O(nˆ2)"
  }
}
```
