# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository was made to support the learning of algorithm analysis and data structures.

## Sorting algorithms

Sorting algorithms are a nice study case to learn algorithm analysis since it is possible to visualize how simple changes to the code influence the better/worst scenario. Here we have implemented the following techniques and with their respective description.

```json
{
  "sorting/": {
    "bubble-sort": "O(nˆ2)",
    "counting-sort": "O(n)",
    "heap-sort": "O(nlogn)",
    "insertion-sort": "O(nˆ2)",
    "merge-sort": "O(nlogn)",
    "quick-sort": "O(nlogn)",
    "radix-sort": "O(n)",
    "selection-sort": "O(nˆ2)"
  }
}
```

## Data Structures

### Linear Lists

There are a bunch of implementation of linear lists. Here are a few of them and their basic functions: `[initialize, show, search, insert, remove]`.

```json
{
  "linear-lists/": {
    "sequential-list": "a basic list where the elements have the same physical and logical order.",
    "linked-list": "a list where the physical and logical order are not the same.",
    "circular-linked-list": "a list where the elements forms a circle.",
    "stack": "a list where insertions and removals happens at the beginning of the structure.",
    "deque": "stack and a queue implemented in the same structure.",
    "queue": "a list where insertions are at the end and removals are at the beginning."
  }
}
```
